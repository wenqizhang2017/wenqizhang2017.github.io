abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential for optimal control
  of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Current research on
  RL in HVAC systems control is limited to simulation studies, with few real-world
  deployments that have minimal focus on supply-side optimization, along with a reliance
  on building simulation tools for pre-training. This paper proposes a practical data-driven
  pre-training framework for Air-Source Heat Pump (ASHP) system. The framework integrates
  data-driven models based on real-world historical data for load forecasting, equipment
  energy consumption, and heat transfer. As a case study, two classic value-based
  reinforcement learning agents, Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN), were selected
  to dynamically control the number and frequency of pumps and the supply water temperature
  based on the fluctuating outdoor dry bulb temperature and building cooling load.
  The pre-training results indicate that DQN achieved energy-saving rates of 4.70%
  for the training data and 4.65% for the testing data, while Q-learning performed
  at -0.66% and 1.28% respectively, indicating that both agents outperformed historical
  control strategies, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the pre-training
  framework. After pre-training, each agent was deployed back into the real-world
  system for two days of field validation. During deployment, both agents outperformed
  the rule-based control, with DQN achieving an energy-saving rate of 9.28% and Q-learning
  achieving 9.04%, demonstrating that the proposed framework enables RL agents to
  continue real-world learning with an enhanced control strategy. This study provides
  a novel pre-training paradigm for implementing RL agents in supply-side control
  of HVAC systems, potentially enhancing both RL deployment and its online evolution.
